# Green Space Estimation

This project is focused on estimating green space accessibility and visibility for urban structures using geospatial data. 
It includes methods for identifying trees and parks near buildings, evaluating visibility based on distance buffers, and analyzing spatial relationships using geographic data processing tools.
